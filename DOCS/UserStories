Scope

We want to develop a website  that will help organize and provide information on study groups or tutoring sessions going on in real time (within a couple of days).  Students will be able to navigate to a website where they will be able to search for a specific class to see if there are any “study groups” or “tutoring sessions” going on that day or in the near future.  For example, Brandon has a big exam in CIS411 that he needs to study for.  He has missed a couple of in-class notes and would like to meet with someone or a group in order to properly prepare for the exam.  Brandon decided to log into StudyCards.com and search for his class, CIS411.  Some students have decided to study in a group and posted the meeting on StudyCards.com.  The study group organizer has invited other students to join in the library at 5:00PM Monday.  Brandon posts that he will be attending the study session and later in the day, meets the group to study for the CIS411 Exam.
